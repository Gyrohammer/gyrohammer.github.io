# Welcome to my Emporium!

## [Kobra Go Mods](https://gyrohammer.github.io/KGM/){target=_blank}
This is a collection of all my modifications that I have made to my Kobra Go 3D printer. The goal of this repo is to track changes, have useful tutorials, and continually update my experience with this machine.

## [Twitchyfin](https://github.com/Gyrohammer/twitchyfin-docker){target=_blank}
A twitch vod downloader and sorter, akin to JellyFin. This project is in extremely early development stages and will be continued at some point (tm).

## Data Analytics
Currently developed for internal use at my company, this software may at one point see the light of day. Once stripped of all its sensitive aspects, anyway.
